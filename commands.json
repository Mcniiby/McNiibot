Siyalatas gives you a +100% multiplier level 4, so you get double your damage. Each rank of Siya gives 25%, each hero soul gives a 10% bonus. They stack with your total DPS multiplicatively. So if you have 100 damage, 10 hero souls, and a level 4 (100%) Siya: `100 damage * 2 (+100% HS damage) * 2 (+100% Siya damage) = 400` damage If you were to level up Siya at that point for 5 HS: `100 damage * 1.5 (+50% HS damage) * 2.25 (+125% Siya damage) = 337.5 damage`\n\nIn another scenario, you have 100 HS and a level 4 Siyalatas. You normally do 100 damage without the bonuses, so with the 100 HS you do 100 + 1000% = 1100\n\nThe level 4 Siyalatas the increases that damage to 1100 + 100% = 2200 damage. Upgrading Siyalatas in this case would cost you 5 Hero Souls, which would leave your bank at 95 HS left. This means your new damage would be:\n\n100 damage + 950 % + 125 % = 2362,5 damage.\n\nSo as you can see, upgrading Siy isn't always going to increase your total DPS.
